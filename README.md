📊 Business Analysis & Insights

1️⃣ Top Selling Products
A small set of products contributes a major share of total sales, indicating high
reliance on key revenue-generating items.

2️⃣ Revenue Trends Over Time
Sales fluctuate across time periods, with noticeable peaks during certain intervals,
suggesting seasonal demand or promotional influence.

3️⃣ High Value Categories
Certain categories consistently outperform others and play a critical role in total
revenue contribution.

4️⃣ Region-wise Sales Performance
Sales distribution varies significantly by region, highlighting strong markets as well
as regions with growth potential.

Several discount points show high sales with low or negative profit, indicating
over-discounting risks.

Optimizing discount strategies and focusing on core products, categories, and regions
